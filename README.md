# 1. LoRa AS32 

AS32-TTL-1W is a 1W industrial wireless data transceiver with high stability, operates at 433MHz. The module
adopts SX1278 incorporating the LORA spread spectrum modem and efficient loop error correction algorithm,
which greatly improves the anti-interference ability and stability. It has four operation modes and can be switched
freely in the runtime. In power saving mode, the current consumption is extremely low, ideal for applications of
ultra-low current consumption.
